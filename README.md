# BuildingAIChanger

This mod adds a field next to the Asset Property editor that lets you enter any building AI (or rather, any PrefabAI) available to the game.

Currently, you do need to know the exact name of the AI class. If you enter a class that doesn't exist, you won't do any harm. The main intended use is of this mod is to ease the creation of buildings with custom AI classes.

Existing properties on the current AI instance are carried over to the new AI as far as possible, but this part is still very much a work-in-progress. It's probably a good idea to select the proper AI as early as possible to avoid problems.
